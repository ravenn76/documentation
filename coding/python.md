## 1. What's pyton
Python is a interpret language create with C. It's use for data science and also hacking. It's easy to learn but that's a great programming language.

## 2. Variable

Here's how to create a variable in python : 

```python
variable = 1
```

In python you don't need to give a type to the variable. Python does it automaticly.

Here's the commons datas types in python :

- str (String) = char string
- int (Integer) = round number
- float (Floated number) = number with decimal
- bool (Boolean) = true statement of false statement (0/1)

*?* In python we use snake_case not CamelCase *?*

## 3. Condition

To create a condition in python you need to create if statement : 

```python
variable = 3
if variable = 3 :
    print("Hello world") # print is for return something on the console 
```

In python to create code block we don't use {} we use a tabulation with ":" at the start of the code block.

We can now use a else statement (if the if statement fail the else statement will be executed) :

```python
variable = 2
if variable = 3 :
    print("Hello world")
else :
    print("Hey world")
```

If we want to use multiple if we can use the elif statement to avoid all the if to run :

```python
variable = 5
if variable = 3 :
    print("Hello world")

elif variable = 5:  # If the if work the elif statement will not be executed. But if it didn't the elif statement will be executed.
    print("Yo world") 

else :
    print("Hey world")
```

## 4. Loop
